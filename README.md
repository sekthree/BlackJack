# BlackJack
Another early homework assignment learning python, a game of blackjack.

How-To: place the blackjack file in your jupyter directory. Open in Jupyter, run the first cell to initialize all classes,
  then run the second cell for actual game play.

There were certain things I hadn't learned yet when assigned this homework project, 
however I attempted them in regards to my knowledge from other OOP, like setters, getters, and private variables

A few of these things I needed to research and find how to impliment them in python, so I might have done something
wrong or not completely correct, but that's part of the learning process.
